A generic IRC bot, originally for running ^Lumi^ in #starcitizen on
QuakeNet.  As such some of the older features may seem esoteric.

It has various functions, including:

  * Keep an eye on the crowdfund level, reporting milestones.
  * Report new RSS feed entries.
  * Reminders about things like Wingman's Hangar shows.

All code is provided as-is under the GPL Version 2.
