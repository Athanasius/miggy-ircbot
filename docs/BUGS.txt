Weird select with keep-alive servers.

This was observed against

<https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/56a60d089657ba197a730a88>

on 2016-01-25.  Immediate symptom was it would take approx. 1 minute to
get the result back.

A LOT of investigation pointed to something weird with POE and select.
It looked like it was select()'ing on the correct file descriptor to
continue getting data, but the select() was returning that fd as not
ready until after the connection was closed.  At that point select()
would trigger reading and the whole request would complete.

strace showed actual system read() as having already retrieved
everything, and thus this is likely the cause of perl's select() saying
"nothing ready there".  However perl's sysread() in 4096 byte chunks had not
yet actually read everything.

So, POE bug?  Perl bug?  Linux bug?  Oh! Could it be the SSL layer getting
in the way?  sysread() at the level we're using it is getting plain-text,
but the actual read(2) call will be seeing the encrypted data.
