Known Bugs:

*) BotCommand seems to not even run a command if its terminated with a space, i.e. '!url ' produces no output, whereas '!url' will bitch about lack of argument and '!url <anythign else>' will get checked for URI syntax.

FIXED:
  *) !url command needs a URL as an argument, but doesn't complain if you just !url
