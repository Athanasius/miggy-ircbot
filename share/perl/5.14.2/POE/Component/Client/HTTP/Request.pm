=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request - an HTTP request class

=head1 VERSION

version 0.949

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Used internally by POE::Component::Client::HTTP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request encapsulates the state of
requests POE::Component::Client::HTTP requests throughout their life
cycles.  There turns out to be a lot of state to manage.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new NAMED_PARAMETERS

Create a POE::Component::Client::HTTP object to manage a request.  The
constructor takes several named parameters:

=over 2

=item Request => HTTP_REQUEST

A POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request object encapsulates a plain
HTTP::Request.  Required.

=item Factory => POE_COMPONENT_CLIENT_HTTP_REQUESTFACTORY

The request may create additional requests during its lifetime, for
example when following redirects.  The Factory parameter specifies the
POE::Component::Client::HTTP::RequestFactory that may be used to
create them.  Required.

=item Postback => RESPONSE_POSTBACK

POE::Component::Client::HTTP creates a postback that will be used to
send responses to the requesting session.  Required.

=item Progress => PROGRESS_POSTBACK

Sets the progress notification if the user has requested progress
events.  Optional.

=item Proxy

Sets the proxy used for this request, if requested by the user.
Optional.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ID

Return the request's unique ID.

=head2 return_response

Sends a response back to the user's session.  Called by
POE::Component::Client::HTTP when a complete response has arrived.

=head2 add_eof

Called by POE::Component::Client::HTTP to indicate EOF has arrived.

=head2 add_content PARSED_DATA

Called by POE::Component::Client::HTTP to add content data to an
incrementally built response.  If PARSED_DATA is an object, it is
treated like an HTTP::Headers object and its headers are assimilated
into the response being built by the request.  Otherwise the
PARSED_DATA is appended to the response's content.

=head2 timer TIMER

Accessor to manipulate the request's timeout timer.  Sets the
request's timer if TIMER is specified, otherwise merely fetches the
one currently associated with the request.

=head2 create_timer TIMEOUT

Creates and sets a timer for this request.  TIMEOUT is the number of
seconds this request may live.
